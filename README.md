# Galaga Clone

This project is called `Galaga Clone` which is a game developed using SDL2 library to build a custom game development framework focusing on 2D arcade games in C++.
The custom framework consists of a system of classes used to handle graphic rendering, mathematic calculations, timer, game entities, audio, input handling, and asset management.
Using the custom framework, the `Galaga Clone` game is created with similar mechanics as that of Galaga.
